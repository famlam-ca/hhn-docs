# Adding or Modifiying list of NTP Servers

## Summary

Linux uses NTP servers to keep their date and time "current" to the outer world. Some issues can arise when it isn't working.  

## Preamble  

You usually don't have issues with NTP servers, and you should check your DNS and Network first if you have NTP issues.

## Requirements

- Linux Operating System (Tested on EndeavourOS)
- Text Editor

## Steps

1. **Start Editing the NTP Servers File**  

```bash copy
sudo vim /etc/ntp.conf
```  
Use an editor~1~ on the NTP Servers file.  

*This file should be the same for most, if not all Linux Distributions.*

2. **Add or Modify Pools/Servers**  

There is usually a server/pool or multple servers/pools that already exist~3~.  
An example from [Here](https://www.ntppool.org/zone/ca) is:  
```bash copy
server 2.ca.pool.ntp.org
```  

You can usually search the internet for your region's NTP Pool if you wanted to add them.  
Comment out or remove lines if you don't want to use certain pools/servers.

4. **Save your Edits**  

Press `Esc` then `:` then type `wq` then press `Enter`~2~  

*This will save the file and exit you from vim.*  

**You have Finished**  

## Conclusion  

You have now learned to modify your NTP Sources for a Linux OS. Happy Time Shenanigans!~4~

## Notes  

1. The editor can be whatever you want, depending on what you like to use or what is installed. <sub><sup>Nano can be popular.</sup></sub>  
2. This will depend on your editer. `Ctrl-X` `Enter` `Enter` for Nano users.  
3. The file itself may offer some helpful links and information.  
4. `timedatectl` can be used for some time stuff. `date` too.
