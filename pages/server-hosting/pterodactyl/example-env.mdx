# Example Environment

## Base Env Setup

## Database Env Setup

> [NOTE] You've selected the Redis driver for one or more options, please provide valid connection information below. In most cases you can use the defaults provided unless you have modified your setup.

```sh
Redis Host [127.0.0.1]:
 > 127.0.0.1
```

> By default a Redis server instance has no password as it is running locally and inaccessible to the outside world. If this is the case, simply hit enter without entering a value.

```sh
Redis Password:
 >
```

```sh
Redis Port [6379]:
 > 6379
```

> [NOTE] It is highly recommended to not use "localhost" as your database host as we have seen frequent socket connection issues. If you want to use a local connection you should be using "127.0.0.1".

```sh
Database Host [127.0.0.1]:
 > IP for you database server
```

> Please reference your database management systems for specific port requirements.

```sh
Database Port [3306]:
 > 3306
```

```sh
Database Name [panel]:
 > panel
```

> [NOTE] Using the "root" account for MySQL connections is not only highly frowned upon, it is also not allowed by this application. You'll need to have created a MySQL user for this software.

```sh
Database Username [pterodactyl]:
 > pterodactyl
```

> This password should be password used in the database configuration [here](/server-hosting/pterodactyl/installing-pterodactyl-panel#1database-configuration).

```sh
Database Password:
 > <yourpassword>
```
