# Adding or Modifiying list of NTP Servers

## Summary

Linux uses NTP servers to keep their date and time "current" to the outer world.
Some issues can arise when it isn't working.

## Preamble

You usually don't have issues with NTP servers, and you should check your DNS
and Network first if you have NTP issues.

## Requirements

- Linux Operating System (Tested on EndeavourOS)
- Text Editor

## Steps

1. **Start Editing the NTP Servers File**

```bash copy
sudo vim /etc/ntp.conf
```

Use an editor<sup>[1](#notes)</sup> on the NTP Servers file.

_This file should be the same for most, if not all Linux Distributions._

2. **Add or Modify Pools/Servers**

There is usually a server/pool or multple servers/pools that already
exist<sup>[2](#notes)</sup>.  
An example from [Here](https://www.ntppool.org/zone/ca) is:

```bash copy
server 2.ca.pool.ntp.org
```

You can usually search the internet for your region's NTP Pool if you wanted to
add them.  
Comment out or remove lines if you don't want to use certain pools/servers.

4. **Save your Edits**

Press `Esc` then `:` then type `wq` then press `Enter`<sup>[3](#notes)</sup>

_This will save the file and exit you from vim._

**You have Finished**

## Conclusion

You have now learned to modify your NTP Sources for a Linux OS. Happy Time
Shenanigans!<sup>[4](#notes)</sup>

## Notes

1. The editor can be whatever you want, depending on what you like to use or
   what is installed. <sub><sup>Nano can be popular.</sup></sub>
2. The file itself may offer some helpful links and information.
3. This will depend on your editer. `Ctrl-X` `Enter` `Enter` for Nano users.
4. `timedatectl` can be used for some time stuff. `date` too.
