# Enable Nested Virtualization on Proxmox

**_Note_**: VMs with nesting active (vmx/svm flag) cannot be live-migrated! To be done on the physical PVE host (or any other hypervisor).

To enable nested hardware-assisted virtualization:

- Ensure you have an AMD CPU or a very recent Intel one.
- Ensure your kernel version is >= 3.10 (usually the case after Proxmox VE 4.x).
- Enable nested support.

### Check Nested Virtualization Status

To check if nested virtualization is enabled:

```bash copy
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
```

```bash filename="Output"
N
```

If it shows "N", it means it's not enabled. To activate it for Intel CPUs:

```bash copy
echo "options kvm-intel nested=Y" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf
```

For AMD CPUs:

```bash copy
echo "options kvm-amd nested=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-amd.conf
```

Reboot or reload the kernel module:

```bash copy
modprobe -r kvm_intel
modprobe kvm_intel
```

Check again:

```bash copy
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
```

```bash filename="Output"
Y
```

**_Note:_** Pay attention to the use of dash "-" and underscore "\_" in the module names.

### Configure Virtual Machine

Then, create a guest where you install, for example, Proxmox as nested Virtualization Environment. Set the CPU type to "host":

```bash copy
qm set <vmid> --cpu host
```

### Verify Nested Virtualization

Once the guest OS is installed, if it's GNU/Linux, you can enter and verify that hardware virtualization support is enabled by doing:

```bash copy
egrep '(vmx|svm)' --color=always /proc/cpuinfo
```

That's it! You've enabled nested hardware-assisted virtualization.

Happy virtualizing!
